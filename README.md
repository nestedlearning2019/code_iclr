# Keras and Tenserflow implementation for the paper : Nested Learning for multi-granular tasks
This anonymous github repository corresponds to the code for the ICLR 2020 submission : [Nested Learning for multi-granular tasks]((https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Byxl-04KvH)). The goal of this open source code is to show how we implemented the concept
of nested learning for simple classification problems, but also to encourage the reader to try its own architecture.
The architecture we chose is indeed not the main contribution of the paper, so you are welcom to try any new architecture that somehow stick
to the general framework presented in section 2 of the paper, described by the following image.
